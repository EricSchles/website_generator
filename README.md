# website_generator
generates a simple website, on the fly

making use of website_generator is really, really easy.  Simply give it a directory with your html and let website generator do the rest!
(Scary ain't it?)

Of course, this will only render the html for you and set up your routes.  But it saves you some time, if you already have
the html code ready to go.

##How to use:

python generator.py [directory with your html pages]

The example that comes with the repo:

python generator.py testing
